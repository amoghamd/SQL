--1. You are given a table, Projects, containing three columns: Task_ID, Start_Date and End_Date. 
    --It is guaranteed that the difference between the End_Date and the Start_Date is equal to 1 day for each row in the table.
    --If the End_Date of the tasks are consecutive, then they are part of the same project. Samantha is interested in finding the total number of different projects completed.
    --Write a query to output the start and end dates of projects listed by the number of days it took to complete the project in ascending order. 
    --If there is more than one project that have the same number of completion days, then order by the start date of the project.
